You try talking to the bed, surprisingly the bed doesnt respond.
*this is utterly pointless*
The bed seems really cosy, you now really want to lay in the bed.
*this is utterly pointless*
You were crushed by the bed
You take you fighting stance and leap with great power to attack the bed, you immediately after touching the bed fell asleep.
*you fell of the bed, it hurt*
The bed opens up to you and lets you in gently, you eeped (sleeped) very well.
*the bed used reversed cursed technique on you so you restored some heath*
The bed isnt opening, you no longer need to rest.
*your hp is full*
You tried talking to the cat, it stared back with eternal malice.
*this is utterly terrifying*
You look at the cat, the cat mew back at you so you didnt understand.
*this is utterly cuteful*
I told you not to do that
*Such a cruel monster you are!*
Hey, dont do that, that´s not cool >:( !!!
*the cat used domain amplification so she wasn´t hurt, BUT YOU GOT*
The cat wasns´t fond of your pets, she bit you.
*the more you F around, the more you find out*
The cat seems pleased as you hear her gentle purrs.
*you are playing with danger*
The crate is cheery, but it cant express itself, its just a crate.
*this is utterly pointless*
Looking at the crate it reminds you of a memory long forgotten.
*this is utterly memoryless*
You fought the crate, it didnt fight back, you now feel bad about yourself.
*this is utterly pointless*
You gently kicked the living hell out of the crate, and the crate thanked you, you obtained a blaster from the crate.
*turns out i was a masochist crate, it also kinda hurt*
The kicked crate smiles at you.
*but you can see it, it doesnt have a mouth*
