Welcome, welcome I have been waiting for you.
*Interesting*
Looks strong, probably could beat him with a gun or something.
*Whats that on his arm?*
Wow such immense strength! I hereby promote you to a soldier, you should go on an expedition to kill Le Evil Alien, but you can do that because i lost the keys to the space ship, you need to find them
Pathetic, do you think someone this weak can join the army? Hahaha.
You are too strong for the likes of me.
*Thats what I thought*
You dont work for me so I dont have any missions for you.
*Makes sense*
Great you found them, now go into the spaceship and go kill some aliens!
*Too bad, we dont kill them, we spare them!*
Find my lost keys to the spaceship
*Where could they be?*
Congratulations I knew you could do it, you should get your medal for heroism in four to five business days
*Great, you won the game YAY! you can still go around maybe you would wanna visit the terminal or maybe the casino.*
